<hr color="red">
<p>Searching means finding derived element in given list of elements.<br>There are two types of searching<br>1.Linear Search.<br>2.Binary Search</p>
<hr>
<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">1.Linear Search:-</h3>
<p>Basic and simple method of searching on this search, we access each element of an array one by one sequencially and see whether it is derived.<br>A searc wull be unsuccessful if all the elements are accessed and the derived element is not formed.<br>It is also called as sequential search.<br>If the derived element is present in 1st position of the array , then only are are comparison is reduced.<br>Best case complexity- O(1).<br>If the derived element is present in the last position,then n comparisons are required<br>Worst case complexity- O(1)</p>
<hr><h3 style="color: darkgreen;">2.Binary Search</h3>
<p>Extremely efficient algorithm.This algorithm searches element in minimum possible comparisons.<br>The only drawback is that here list of elements must be saved.<br>There are 3 cases<br>i) If it is derived element then search is successful.<br>ii) If it is less than derived item then search only in the first half of the array.<br>iii) If it is greater than derived item then search only in the 2nd half of the array.<br>Repeat these steps until an element is found pr array is over .<br>In this searching,we are reading the array in every step<br>Worst case complexity- log(n+1)</p>
