<h1 style="text-align: center;">Python Multilevel Inheritance</h1>
<hr color="red">


<p>We can also inherit from a derived class. This is called multilevel inheritance. It can be of any depth in Python.</p>
<p>In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class are inherited into the new derived class.</p>
<p>An example with corresponding visualization is given below.</p>
<pre>class Base:
    pass

class Derived1(Base):
    pass

class Derived2(Derived1):
    pass</pre>
<p>Here, the Derived1 class is derived from the Base class, and the Derived2 class is derived from the Derived1 class</p>
