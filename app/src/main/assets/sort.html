<hr color="red">
<p>A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure. </p>

<h3><u style="color: darkgreen;">Types of sorting</u></h3>

<p><b style="color: darkgreen;">1.Selection Sort- </b> The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

	<br>1) The sub-array which is already sorted.
	<br>2) Remaining sub-array which is unsorted.

	<br>In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.</p>
<hr>
<p><b style="color: darkgreen;">2.Bubble sort-</b>  Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.</p>
<hr>
<p><b style="color: darkgreen;">3.Insertion sort-</b> Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.</p>
<hr>	<p><b style="color: darkgreen;">4.Merge sort-</b> Like QuickSort, Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one. See following C implementation for details.</p>
<hr>	<p><b style="color: darkgreen;">5.Quick sort- </b> Like Merge Sort, QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.<br>1. Always pick first element as pivot.
	<br> 2.Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
	<br>3. Pick a random element as pivot.
	<br>4. Pick median as pivot.
