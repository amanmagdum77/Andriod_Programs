<ul>
    <li><strong>Mesh Topology: </strong>In mesh topology, every device is connected to another device via particular channel.If suppose, N number of devices are connected with each other, then total number of links required to connect NC2.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Bus Topology: </strong>Bus topology is a network type in which every computer and network device is connected to single cable. If N devices are connected, then the number of cables required 1 which is known as backbone cable and N drop lines are required.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Star Topology: </strong>In star topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable. If N devices are connected to each other, then the no. of cables required N. </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Ring Topology: </strong>In this topology, it forms a ring connecting a devices with its exactly two neighboring devices. </li>
    <br>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: hsl(120, 100%, 20%);">Transmission Modes:  </h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Simplex Mode: </strong> the communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street.Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Half-duplex Mode: </strong>each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Full-duplex Mode: </strong>both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.</li>
    <br>
</ul>
<h3 style="color: hsl(120, 100%, 20%);">Manchester Encoding </h3>
When there is a long sequence of 0s and 1s, there is a problem at the receiving end. The problem is that the synchronization is lost due to lack of transmissions.
<ul>
    <li><strong>NRZ-level encoding: </strong>The polarity of signals changes when incoming siganl changes from ‘1’ to ‘0’ or from ‘0’ to ‘1’. It considers the first bit data as polarity change.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>NRZ-Inverted/ Differential encoding:</strong>In this, the transitions at the beginning of bit interval is equal to 1 and if there is no transition at the beginning of bit interval is equal to 0.</li>
</ul>
