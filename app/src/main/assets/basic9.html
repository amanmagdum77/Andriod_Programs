<h1 style="text-align: center">Python For Loops</h1>
<hr color="red" />


<h3 style="color: darkgreen">Python For Loops</h3>
<p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</p>
<p>This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</p>

<p>With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
<pre>Example
  Print each fruit in a fruit list:

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  for x in fruits:
    print(x)</pre>
<p>The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand</p>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen">Looping Through a String</h3>
<p>Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:</p>
<pre>Example
        Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

        for x in "banana":
          print(x)
        </pre>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen">The range() Function</h3>
<p>
    To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,</p>
<p>The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

</p>
<pre>Example
  Using the range() function:

  for x in range(6):
    print(x)</pre>
<b>Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.</b>
<p>The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(2, 6), which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):
</p>
<pre>Example
  Using the start parameter:

  for x in range(2, 6):
    print(x)</pre>
<p>The range() function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: range(2, 30, 3):</p>
<pre>Example
  Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):

  for x in range(2, 30, 3):
    print(x)</pre>
















<h3 style="color: darkgreen">Else in For Loop</h3>
<p>The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:</p>
<pre>Example
  Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:

  for x in range(6):
    print(x)
  else:
    print("Finally finished!")</pre>
<b>Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.</b>
<pre>Example
  Break the loop when x is 3, and see what happens with the else block:

  for x in range(6):
    if x == 3: break
    print(x)
  else:
    print("Finally finished!")</pre>






<h3 style="color: darkgreen">Nested Loops</h3>
<p>A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.</p>
<p>The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":</p>
<pre>Example
  Print each adjective for every fruit:

  adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  for x in adj:
    for y in fruits:
      print(x, y)</pre>
