<h1 style="text-align: center;">Introduction To Data Structure</h1>
<hr color="red">
<p>Data structure is representation of the logical relationship existing between individual element of data In other word a data structure is a way of organizing all data items that considers not only the elements stored but also their relationship to each other. </p>
<hr>
<b style="color: darkgreen;">Data structure mainly specify following things:</b>

<h style="text-align: center;"> <br>1.Organizing of data.
    <br>2.Accessing of associativity.
    <br>3.Degree of associativity.
    <br>4.processing alternative for information.</h>
<hr>
<p>Data structure are the building block of a program.and hence the selection of particular data structure of following things.

    <br>1.The data structure must be rich enough in structure to reflect the relationship existing between the data

    <br>2.and the structure should be simple so that we can process data efficiency whenever required.</p>
<hr>
<p>Data structure affect both structural and functional aspects of program

    Algorithm + Data structure=Program

    <br>Classification of data structure:

    <br>1. primitive data structure.

    <br>2. Non_primitive data structure.</p>
<hr>
<p><b style="color: darkgreen;">1.Primitive data structure:</b>

    <br>These are basic structures and are directly operated upon by the machine instruction. These in general have different representation on different computers integer,floating point numbers,characters constant string constant,pointers etc.</p>
<hr>
<p ><b style="color: darkgreen;">2.Non _primitive Data structure:</b>
    <br>These are more sophisticated data structure.These are derived from the primitive data structure.The non_primitive data structure emphasis on structuring of the group of homogeneous data items.array and list are examples.</p>
<hr>
<p><b style="color: darkgreen;">Other operation of data structure include:</b>

    <br> 1.Searching

    <br> 2.Sorting

    <br>3.Merging</p>
<hr>
<p ><b style="color: darkgreen;">Searching: </b><br>This operation finds the desired data item in the list of data item. it also may find the location of all elements that satisfy certain conditions</p>
<hr><p><b style="color: darkgreen;">Sorting:</b><br>A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure. </p>
<hr><p ><b style="color: darkgreen;">Merging</b><br>Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being ÎŸ(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.</p>
