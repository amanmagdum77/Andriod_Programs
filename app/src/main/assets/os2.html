<p>
    A thread is a lightweight process and forms the basic unit of CPU utilization. A process can perform more than one task at the same time by including multiple threads.
<ul>
    <li>A thread has its own program counter, register set, and stack</li>
    <br>
    <li>A thread shares resources with other threads of the same process the code section, the data section, files and signals.</li>
</ul>
A new thread, or a child process of a given process, can be introduced by using the fork() system call. A process with n fork() system calls generates 2n – 1 child processes.

There are two types of threads:
<br>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User Threads :</strong>
        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>User threads are implemented by users.</li>
            <br>
            <li>OS doesn’t recognize user level threads.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Implementation of User threads is easy.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Context switch time is less.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Context switch requires no hardware support.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If one user level thread performs blocking operation then entire process will be blocked.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Kernel Threads :</strong>
        <br><br>
        <ol>
            <li>kernel threads are implemented by OS.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Kernel threads are recognized by OS.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Implementation of Kernel thread is complicated.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Context switch time is more.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Hardware support is needed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>If one kernel thread performs blocking operation then another thread can continue execution.</li>

        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
