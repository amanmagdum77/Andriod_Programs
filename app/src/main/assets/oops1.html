<h1 style="text-align: center;">Python OOPS</h1>
<hr color="red">




<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">OOPs in Python</h3>
<p>OOPs in Python is a programming approach that focuses on using objects and classes as same as other general programming languages. The objects can be any real-world entities. Python allows developers to develop applications using the OOPs approach with the major focus on code reusability. It is very easy to create classes and objects in Python.</p>




<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">What is a Class?</h3>
<p>A Class in Python is a logical grouping of data and functions. It gives the freedom to create data structures that contains arbitrary content and hence easily accessible.</p>
<p>For example, for any bank employee who want to fetch the customer details online would go to customer class, where all its attributes like transaction details, withdrawal and deposit details, outstanding debt, etc. would be listed out..</p>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">How to define Python classes</h3>
<p>To define class you need to consider following points</p>
<p>Step 1) In Python, classes are defined by the "Class" keyword</p>
<pre>
class myClass():</pre>


<p>Step 2) Inside classes, you can define functions or methods that are part of this class</p>
<pre>
def method1 (self):
    print "Guru99"
def method2 (self,someString):
    print "Software Testing:" + someString</pre>

<ul>
    <li>Here we have defined method1 that prints "Guru99."</li>
    <li>Another method we have defined is method2 that prints "Software Testing"+ SomeString. SomeString is the variable supplied by the calling method</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 3) Everything in a class is indented, just like the code in the function, loop, if statement, etc. Anything not indented is not in the class</p>

<p>NOTE: About using "self" in Python</p>
<ul>
    <li>The self-argument refers to the object itself. Hence the use of the word self. So inside this method, self will refer to the specific instance of this object that's being operated on.</li>
    <li>Self is the name preferred by convention by Pythons to indicate the first parameter of instance methods in Python. It is part of the Python syntax to access members of objects</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 4) To make an object of the class</p>
<pre>c = myClass()</pre>

<p>Step 5) To call a method in a class</p>
<pre>    c.method1()
    c.method2(" Testing is fun")</pre>

<ul>
    <li>Notice that when we call the method1 or method2, we don't have to supply the self-keyword. That's automatically handled for us by the Python runtime</li>
    <li>Python runtime will pass "self" value when you call an instance method on in instance, whether you provide it deliberately or not</li>
    <li>You just have to care about the non-self arguments</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 6) Here is the complete code</p>
<pre># Example file for working with classes
    class myClass():
      def method1(self):
          print("Guru99")

      def method2(self,someString):
          print("Software Testing:" + someString)


    def main():
      # exercise the class methods
      c = myClass ()
      c.method1()
      c.method2(" Testing is fun")

    if __name__== "__main__":
      main()</pre>
