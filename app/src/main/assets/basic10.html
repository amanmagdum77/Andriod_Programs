<hr color="red" />


<h3 style="color: darkgreen">The while Loop</h3>
<p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
<pre>Example
    Print i as long as i is less than 6:

    i = 1
    while i < 6:
      print(i)
      i += 1</pre>
<b>Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.</b>
<p>The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.</p>
<h3 style="color: darkgreen"> Python Do While Loop</h3>
<p>Python doesn't have do-while loop. But we can create a program like this.</p>
<p>The do while loop is used to check condition after executing the statement. It is like while loop but it is executed at least once.</p>
<pre>do {
  //statement
} while (condition);  </pre>
<b>Python Do While Loop Example</b>
<pre>i = 1

  while True:
      print(i)
      i = i + 1
      if(i > 5):
          break  </pre>
<pre>Output:

  1
  2
  3
  4
  5  </pre>
