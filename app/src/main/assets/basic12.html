<h1 style="text-align: center">Python continue statement</h1>
<hr color="red" />
<p>The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.</p>

<pre>Syntax of Continue
    continue</pre>
<img src="basic12_1.PNG"  width="100%" height="100%" alt="Flowchart of continue">
<p>The working of continue statement in for and while loop is shown below.</p>
<img src="basic12_2.PNG"  width="100%" height="100%" alt="Working of break statement">
<pre>Example: Python continue
    # Program to show the use of continue
    #statement inside loops

    for val in "string":
        if val == "i":
            continue
        print(val)

    print("The end")</pre>
<pre>Output

    s
    t
    r
    n
    g
    The end</pre>
<p>This program is same as the above example except the break statement has been replaced with continue</p>
<p>We continue with the loop, if the string is i, not executing the rest of the block. Hence, we see in our output that all the letters except i gets printed.</p>
