<h1 style="text-align: center;">Python Exception Handling</h1>
<hr color="red">
<h3 style="color: hsl(120, 100%, 20%);">Exceptions in Python</h3>
<p>Python has many built-in exceptions that are raised when your program encounters an error (something in the program goes wrong).</p>
<p>When these exceptions occur, the Python interpreter stops the current process and passes it to the calling process until it is handled. If not handled, the program will crash.</p>
<p>For example, let us consider a program where we have a function A that calls function B, which in turn calls function C. If an exception occurs in function C but is not handled in C, the exception passes to B and then to A.</p>
<p>If never handled, an error message is displayed and our program comes to a sudden unexpected halt.</p>
<hr>
<h3 style="color: hsl(120, 100%, 20%);">Catching Exceptions in Python</h3>
<p>In Python, exceptions can be handled using a try statement.</p>
<p>The critical operation which can raise an exception is placed inside the try clause. The code that handles the exceptions is written in the except clause.</p>
<p>We can thus choose what operations to perform once we have caught the exception. Here is a simple example.</p>
<pre># import module sys to get the type of exception
    import sys

    randomList = ['a', 0, 2]

    for entry in randomList:
        try:
            print("The entry is", entry)
            r = 1/int(entry)
            break
        except:
            print("Oops!", sys.exc_info()[0], "occurred.")
            print("Next entry.")
            print()
    print("The reciprocal of", entry, "is", r)</pre>

<img src="oops8_2.PNG"  width="100%" height="100%" alt="Multilevel Inheritance">

<p>In this program, we loop through the values of the randomList list. As previously mentioned, the portion that can cause an exception is placed inside the try block.</p>
<p>If no exception occurs, the except block is skipped and normal flow continues(for last value). But if any exception occurs, it is caught by the except block (first and second values).</p>
<p>Here, we print the name of the exception using the exc_info() function inside sys module. We can see that a causes ValueError and 0 causes ZeroDivisionError.</p>
<p>Since every exception in Python inherits from the base Exception class, we can also perform the above task in the following way:</p>
<pre># import module sys to get the type of exception
    import sys

    randomList = ['a', 0, 2]

    for entry in randomList:
        try:
            print("The entry is", entry)
            r = 1/int(entry)
            break
        except Exception as e:
            print("Oops!", e.__class__, "occurred.")
            print("Next entry.")
            print()
    print("The reciprocal of", entry, "is", r)</pre>
<p>This program has the same output as the above program.</p>
<hr>

<h3 style="color: hsl(120, 100%, 20%);">Catching Specific Exceptions in Python</h3>
<p>In the above example, we did not mention any specific exception in the except clause.</p>
<p>This is not a good programming practice as it will catch all exceptions and handle every case in the same way. We can specify which exceptions an except clause should catch.</p>
<p>A try clause can have any number of except clauses to handle different exceptions, however, only one will be executed in case an exception occurs.</p>
<p>We can use a tuple of values to specify multiple exceptions in an except clause. Here is an example pseudo code.</p>
<pre>try:
    # do something
    pass

 except ValueError:
    # handle ValueError exception
    pass

 except (TypeError, ZeroDivisionError):
    # handle multiple exceptions
    # TypeError and ZeroDivisionError
    pass

 except:
    # handle all other exceptions
    pass</pre>
<hr>

<h3 style="color: hsl(120, 100%, 20%);">Raising Exceptions in Python</h3>
<p>In Python programming, exceptions are raised when errors occur at runtime. We can also manually raise exceptions using the raise keyword.</p>
<p>We can optionally pass values to the exception to clarify why that exception was raised.</p>
<pre>>>> raise KeyboardInterrupt
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    KeyboardInterrupt

    >>> raise MemoryError("This is an argument")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    MemoryError: This is an argument

    >>> try:
    ...     a = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
    ...     if a &lt= 0:
    ...         raise ValueError("That is not a positive number!")
    ... except ValueError as ve:
    ...     print(ve)
    ...
    Enter a positive integer: -2
    That is not a positive number!</pre>
<hr>
<h3 style="color: hsl(120, 100%, 20%);">Python try with else clause</h3>
<p>In some situations, you might want to run a certain block of code if the code block inside try ran without any errors. For these cases, you can use the optional else keyword with the try statement.</p>
<p>Note: Exceptions in the else clause are not handled by the preceding except clauses.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example:</p>
<pre># program to print the reciprocal of even numbers

    try:
        num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
        assert num % 2 == 0
    except:
        print("Not an even number!")
    else:
        reciprocal = 1/num
        print(reciprocal)</pre>
<pre>Output

    If we pass an odd number:

    Enter a number: 1
    Not an even number!</pre>
<p>If we pass an even number, the reciprocal is computed and displayed.</p>
<pre>Enter a number: 4
    0.25</pre>
<p>However, if we pass 0, we get ZeroDivisionError as the code block inside else is not handled by preceding except.</p>

<h3 style="color: hsl(120, 100%, 20%);">Python try...finally</h3>
<p>The try statement in Python can have an optional finally clause. This clause is executed no matter what, and is generally used to release external resources.</p>
<p>For example, we may be connected to a remote data center through the network or working with a file or a Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p>
<p>In all these circumstances, we must clean up the resource before the program comes to a halt whether it successfully ran or not. These actions (closing a file, GUI or disconnecting from network) are performed in the finally clause to guarantee the execution.</p>
<p>Here is an example of file operations to illustrate this.</p>
<pre>try:
    f = open("test.txt",encoding = 'utf-8')
    # perform file operations
 finally:
    f.close()</pre>
<p>This type of construct makes sure that the file is closed even if an exception occurs during the program execution.</p>
