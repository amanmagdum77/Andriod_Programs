<h1 style="text-align: center;">Constructors in Python</h1>
<hr color="red">




<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Constructors</h3>





<p>Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object.The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created.In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created.</p>
<p><b>Syntax of constructor declaration :</b></p>
<pre>def __init__(self):
    # body of the constructor</pre>

<p><b>Types of constructors :</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>default constructor</b>:The default constructor is simple constructor which doesn’t accept any arguments.It’s definition has only one argument which is a reference to the instance being constructed.</li>
    <li><b>parameterized constructor</b>:constructor with parameters is known as parameterized constructor.The parameterized constructor take its first argument as a reference to the instance being constructed known as self and the rest of the arguments are provided by the programmer.</li>
</ul>










<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">The __init__() Function</h3>
<p>The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.</p>
<p>To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.</p>
<p>All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.</p>
<p>Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:</p>


<pre>Create a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age:

    class Person:
      def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    p1 = Person("John", 36)

    print(p1.name)
    print(p1.age)</pre>


<p>Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
