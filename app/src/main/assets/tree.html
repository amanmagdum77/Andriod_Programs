<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Tree</h1>
<hr color="red">
<p>A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root. <br>It is non-linear data structure, hierarchical data structure<br>very flexible, versatile and powerful data structure that can be used to represent hierarchical relationship between existing data items</p>
<hr><p>1.It is finite set of one or more data items such that <br>i) There is a special data item called <b>Root</b> of the tree.<br>ii)Its remaining data items are partitioned into ni of mutually exclusive subsets each of which is iteslef a tree, they are called as <b>Subtrees</b>.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Tree Terminology:</h3>
<p>1.Root- Special data item in a tree. It is the tree in the hierarchical arrangement of data item.<br>2. Node-  each data item is called a node.It is  basic structure in tree, it specifies the data and links to other data items <br>3.Degree of node- It is the number pf subtrees of a node in given tree.  <br>4.Degree of tree- It is maximum degree of nodes in given tree.<br>5.Terminal node-  A nod ewith degree 0 is called as terminal node(LEAF).<br>6.Non -terminal node-  any node whose degree is not zero is called as non-terminal node , they are intermediate nodes in traversing the given tree from its root to the terminal nodes(leaf)<br>7.Siblings- The children nodes  of a given parent node are called as siblings, also brothers.<br>8.Edge-  It is connectii=ng line of two nodes,that is line drawn from one node to another node is called as edge.<br>9.Path- It is sequence of consecutive edges from source node to destination node<br> 10.
	Level-  The entire tree structure is levelled in such a way that the root node is always at level 0, then, its  immediate children are at level 1 and their immediate children are at level 2 and so on. upto terminal nodes.In general, if node is at level n then its children will be at level n+1.</p>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Application of tree:</h3>
<p>1.Network routing algorithms<br>2.Organizational structure<br>3.Storing naturally hierarchical data eg. file system<br>4.dictionary<br>5.Parse tree</p>
