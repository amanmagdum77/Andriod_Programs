<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Paging : </h3>
The physical memory is divided into equal sized frames. The main memory is divided into fixed size pages. The size of a physical memory frame is equal to the size of a virtual memory frame.
<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Segmentation : </h3>
Segmentation is implemented to give users view of memory. The logical address space is a collection of segments. Segmentation can be implemented with or without the use of paging.
<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Page Fault : </h3>
A page fault is a type of interrupt, raised by the hardware when a running program accesses a memory page that is mapped into the virtual address space, but not loaded in physical memory
<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Page Replacement Algorithms : </h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>First In First Out (FIFO) : </strong>This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.

        For example, consider page reference string 1, 3, 0, 3, 5, 6 and 3 page slots. Initially, all slots are empty, so when 1, 3, 0 came they are allocated to the empty slots —> 3 Page Faults. When 3 comes, it is already in  memory so —> 0 Page Faults. Then 5 comes, it is not available in  memory so it replaces the oldest page slot i.e 1. —> 1 Page Fault. Finally, 6 comes,  it is also not available in memory so it replaces the oldest page slot i.e 3 —> 1 Page Fault.</li>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Belady’s anomaly : </strong>Belady’s anomaly proves that it is possible to have more page faults when increasing the number of page frames while using the First in First Out (FIFO) page replacement algorithm.  For example, if we consider reference string      3     2     1     0     3     2     4     3     2     1     0     4 and 3 slots, we get 9 total page faults, but if we increase slots to 4, we get 10 page faults.</li>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Optimal Page Replacement : </strong>In this algorithm, pages are replaced which are not used for the longest duration of time in the future.

        Let us consider page reference string 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2 and 4 page slots. Initially, all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the empty slots —> 4 Page faults. 0 is already there so —> 0 Page fault. When 3 came it will take the place of 7 because it is not used for the longest duration of time in the future.—> 1 Page fault. 0 is already there so —> 0 Page fault. 4 will takes place of 1 —> 1 Page Fault. Now for the further page reference string —> 0 Page fault because they are already available in the memory.

        Optimal page replacement is perfect, but not possible in practice as an operating system cannot know future requests. The use of Optimal Page replacement is to set up a benchmark so that other replacement algorithms can be analyzed against it. </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Least Recently Used (LRU) : </strong>In this algorithm, the page will be replaced which is least recently used.Let say the page reference string 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2 . Initially, we have 4-page slots empty. Initially, all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the empty slots —> 4 Page faults. 0 is already their so —> 0 Page fault. When 3 came it will take the place of 7 because it is least recently used —> 1 Page fault. 0 is already in memory so —> 0 Page fault. 4 will takes place of 1 —> 1 Page Fault. Now for the further page reference string —> 0 Page fault because they are already available in the memory.</li>
