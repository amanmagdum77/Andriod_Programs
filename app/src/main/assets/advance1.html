<h1 style="text-align: center;">Python Strings</h1>
<hr color="red">
<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Strings</h3>
<pre>Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function:</pre>
<pre>print("Hello")
print('Hello')
        </pre>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Assign String to a Variable</h3>
<p>You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:</p>
<pre>a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

Or three single quotes:

a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
print(a)</pre>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Strings are Arrays</h3>
<pre>Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.</pre>
<pre>
Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])</pre>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Looping Through a String</h3>
<p>Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.</p>
<pre>
Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "banana":
print(x)</pre>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">String Length</h3>
<p>To get the length of a string, use the len() function.</p>
<pre>The len() function returns the length of a string:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))</pre>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Check String</h3>
<p>To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in..</p>
<pre>Check if "free" is present in the following text:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)</pre>


<p>Use it in an if statement:.</p>
<pre>Print only if "free" is present:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "free" in txt:
    print("Yes, 'free' is present.")</pre>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Check if NOT</h3>
<p>To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in</p>
<pre>Check if "expensive" is NOT present in the following text:

txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("expensive" not in txt)</pre>


<p>print only if "expensive" is NOT present:</p>
<pre>txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "expensive" not in txt:
    print("Yes, 'expensive' is NOT present.")</pre>
