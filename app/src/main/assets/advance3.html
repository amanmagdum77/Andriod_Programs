<h1 style="text-align: center;">Python Lists</h1>
<hr color="red">

<p>mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]</p>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Lists</h3>
<p>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.</p>

<p>Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.</p>

<p>Lists are created using square brackets.</p>
<pre>Create a List:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)</pre>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">List Items</h3>
<p>List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.</p>
<p>List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Single or Double Quotes?</h3>
<p>String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:</p>
<pre>x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'</pre>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Ordered</h3>
<p>When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.</p>
<p>If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.</p>
<p>Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.</p>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Changeable</h3>
<p>The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.</p>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Allow Duplicates</h3>
<p>Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:</p>
<pre>Lists allow duplicate values:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)</pre>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">List Length</h3>
<p>To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:</p>
<pre>Print the number of items in the list:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))</pre>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">List Items - Data Types</h3>
<p>List items can be of any data type:</p>
<pre>String, int and boolean data types:

list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]</pre>

<p>A list can contain different data types:</p>
<pre>A list with strings, integers and boolean values:

list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]</pre>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">type()</h3>
<p>From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':</p>
<pre>What is the data type of a list?

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))</pre>




<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">The list() Constructor</h3>
<p>It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.</p>
<pre>Using the list() constructor to make a List:

thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)</pre>

<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Python Collections (Arrays)</h3>
<p>There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>List</b> is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members</li>
    <li><b>Tuple</b> is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.</li>
    <li><b>Set</b> is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.</li>
    <li><b>Dictionary</b> is a collection which is unordered and changeable. No duplicate members</li>
</ul>
<p>When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type. Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.</p>
