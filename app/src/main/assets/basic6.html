<h1 style="text-align: center;">Python Operators</h1>
<hr color="red">
<p>The operator can be defined as a symbol which is responsible for a particular operation between two operands. Operators are the pillars of a program on which the logic is built in a specific programming language. Python provides a variety of operators, which are described as follows</p>
<ul>
    <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
    <li>Comparison operators</li>
    <li>Assignment Operators</li>
    <li>Logical Operators</li>
    <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
    <li>Membership Operators</li>
    <li>Identity Operators</li>
</ul>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Arithmetic Operators:</h3>
<p>Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations between two operands. It includes + (addition), - (subtraction), *(multiplication), /(divide), %(reminder), //(floor division), and exponent (**) operators.</p>
<p>Consider the following table for a detailed explanation of arithmetic operators.</p>
<table>
    <tr style="color: darkblue;">
        <td>Operator</td>
        <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>+ (Addition)</td>
        <td>It is used to add two operands. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 => a+b = 30</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>- (Subtraction)</td>
        <td>It is used to subtract the second operand from the first operand. If the first operand is less than the second operand, the value results negative. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 => a - b = 10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>/ (divide)</td>
        <td>It returns the quotient after dividing the first operand by the second operand. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 => a/b = 2.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>* (Multiplication)</td>
        <td>It is used to multiply one operand with the other. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 => a * b = 200</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>>
        <td>% (reminder)</td>
        <td>It returns the reminder after dividing the first operand by the second operand. For example, if a = 20, b = 10 => a%b = 0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>** (Exponent)</td>
        <td>It is an exponent operator represented as it calculates the first operand power to the second operand.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>// (Floor division)</td>
        <td>It gives the floor value of the quotient produced by dividing the two operands.</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<h3 style="color: darkgreen;">Comparison operator</h3>
<p>Comparison operators are used to comparing the value of the two operands and returns Boolean true or false accordingly. The comparison operators are described in the following table.</p>
<table>
    <tr style="color: darkblue;">
        <td>Operator</td>
        <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>==</td>
        <td>If the value of two operands is equal, then the condition becomes true.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>!=</td>
        <td>If the value of two operands is not equal, then the condition becomes true.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;=</td>
        <td>If the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand, then the condition becomes true</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;=</td>
        <td>If the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand, then the condition becomes true.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;</td>
        <td>If the first operand is greater than the second operand, then the condition becomes true.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&gt;</td>
        <td>If the first operand is less than the second operand, then the condition becomes true.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
