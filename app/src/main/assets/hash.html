<h1><center>Hashing</center></h1>
<hr color="red">
<p>It is a searching technique based on concept of hash table.<br>It does not require unnecessary comparisons and directly find the location of the number in one access.<br>In this method, the location of derived record present in search table depends only on the given key eg. Table with record of n students, each of which is  defined by roll no. key.<br>Hashing reduces comparisons than binaery search.</p>
<hr>
<p><b style="color: darkgreen;">Hash function:-</b><br>A function that is used to compute the address of a record in the hash table. A hash function transfers X identifier into bucket address in hash table.<br>the address computed is called as hash address of identifier X.<br>If more than one record have same hashing address, then there is collision occur. this is called address collision</p>
